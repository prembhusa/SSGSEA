# SSGSEA
For nearly a decade, the difficulties associated with both the determination and reproducibility of Ras-dependency indexes (RDIs) have limited their application and further delineation of the biology underlying Ras dependency. In this report, we describe the application of a computational single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method to derive RDIs with gene expression data.
